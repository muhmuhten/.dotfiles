# *DO NOT* enable poorly-conceived shell git integrations with this, to avoid
# theoretical code execution (cf. 8959555cee7ec045958f9b6dd62e541affb7e7d9) in
# untrusted repos. I say theoretical because it requires
# - The repo *metadata* (not normally pulled) must be compromised, normally
# only feasible on shared filesystems unless the attacker has arbitrary access
# to the filesystem, in which case they might as well overwrite ~/.profile
# - We don't use a so-called "Git-enabled `PS1`" anyway, and won't use one that
# executes arbitrary code from the git dir unless I suffer a catastrophic lapse
# of taste and also forget about this
